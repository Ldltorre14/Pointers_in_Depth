# Pointers_in_Depth
This is a proyect made for myself to understanding in depth the pointers as a study programa where i learn a topic related to pointers, at least one for day.
In this repository, you can find codes that goes from the basics to advanced concepts related to pointers.
Here I share my daily progress understanding all the topics, sharing code with common errors that i found, solutions to these errors, and many explanations for every
code for understanding in depth the concept of pointers in C and C++
For everybody interested in start to learn, I should recommend to begin with the Day 1 folder, because the topics difficulty increases as the days passes.
I hope you like this proyect and I would very glad if you find this useful!
